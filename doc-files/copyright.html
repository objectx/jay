Berkeley Yacc is an LALR(1) parser generator.  Berkeley Yacc has
been made as compatible as possible with AT&T Yacc.  Berkeley Yacc
can accept any input specification that conforms to the AT&T Yacc
documentation.  Specifications that take advantage of undocumented
features of AT&T Yacc will probably be rejected.

Berkeley Yacc is distributed with no warranty whatever.  The code
is certain to contain errors.  Neither the author nor any contributor
takes responsibility for any consequences of its use.

Berkeley Yacc is in the public domain.  The data structures and
algorithms used in Berkeley Yacc are all either taken from documents
available to the general public or are inventions of the author.
Anyone may freely distribute source or binary forms of Berkeley
Yacc whether unchanged or modified.  Distributers may charge whatever
fees they can obtain for Berkeley Yacc.  Programs generated by
Berkeley Yacc may be distributed freely.

Please report bugs to robert.corbett@eng.Sun.COM Include a small
