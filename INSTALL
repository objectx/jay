installation instructions

(0) if you work with SSCLI, make sure the path to this directory (after resolving any symbolic links) does not contain blanks -- blanks seem to confuse at least SSCLI on MacOS X 10.2.2.

(1) in the current directory, execute 'make'.

This should at least create jay/jay.$(OSTYPE).

If a suitable JDK is installed, it will also create java/yydebug.jar, java/arith/{arith,tables}.jar, and java/recover/{recover,tables}.jar.

If a suitable SSCLI is installed, it will also create cs/yyDebug.dll and install it with a fake strong name in the GAC, cs/arith/arith.exe, and cs/recover/recover.exe.

(2) in the current directory, execute 'make test'.

This should at least run the regression test in conflict/.

If a suitable JDK is installed, it will also test in java/{arith,recover}/.

If a suitable SSCLI is installed, it will also test in cs/{arith,recover}/.

(3) copy jay/jay.$(OSTYPE) to a convenient location.

(4) copy some of {java,cs}/skeleton.* to a convenient location.

(5) you might want to install a skript somewhere with something like

#!/bin/sh
exec [path]/jay < [path]/[skeleton] "$@"

Good luck!
